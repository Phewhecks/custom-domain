                             automated tax calculation module and generates detailed tax reports for compliance. Employees
                              can view and download their payslips, promoting transparency. Additionally, the system offers
                               payroll analysis tools for financial planning and integrates attendance tracking with functionalities 
                               for checking, importing, and managing attendance records. Overall, the Payroll Management System enhances
                                efficiency, accuracy, 
                            and transparency in payroll management for organizations of all sizes..</p>

                    <h2>Helicopter Game</h2>
                    <p>This project was developed during second semester using C++ programming language as part of coursework.
                        Object oriented programming features were learned and implemented was during this project</p>
                        <p class="project-details">The Helicopter Game is a C++ project inspired by the popular game Flappy Bird, 
                            featuring enhanced gameplay elements such as various backgrounds, a menu system, and a score display. 
                            Players control the helicopter's height using the spacebar, aiming to navigate through obstacles like 
                            moving pipes while avoiding collisions with both the pipes and the ground. The game incorporates accurate 
                            object-based movement collision detection to deliver an engaging and immersive gaming experience. By recreating 
                            and expanding on the Flappy Bird mechanics, 
                            this project offers a challenging and enjoyable experience for players.

                    <h2>Collision Detection System </h2>
                    <p>This project was developed during third semester using C programming language and 8051 microcontroller as part of
                         coursework. We also gained knowledge of Assembly language during the course of this project</p>
                         <p class="project-details">The Collision Detection System is a project built on the 8051 microcontroller and 
                            programmed in C, utilizing ultrasonic sensors and other electronics to enhance safety and aid navigation by 
                            detecting the edges of a defined space. The system consists of an 8051 microcontroller, an LCD display, an 
                            ultrasonic sensor, and a buzzer. The ultrasonic sensor measures distance by emitting sound waves, which are 
                            then processed by the microcontroller. The microcontroller calculates the object's distance using the time 
                            taken for sound waves to return and displays this distance on the LCD. If the object is detected within a 
                            predefined range, the buzzer sounds an alert. This versatile system can be integrated into applications such 
                            as robotic navigation, security, and alert systems, providing a safety mechanism to prevent accidents caused 
                            by human error. Overall, it offers a responsive collision detection solution that enhances safety in various 
                            environments.

                    <h2>Student Record System</h2>
                    <p>This project was developed during first semester using the C programming language as part of coursework. 
                        This project allowed me to learn various programming concepts.</p>
                        <p class="project-details">“Student Record System” is developed to maintain the details of student such as first name, 
                            last name, gpa, course in any school or any educational institute. Every institute uses a way of record system 
                            to save the information of the students there. As in various rural areas it is found that educational institute 
                            uses physical method of record keeping meaning with copies and paper etc. There is various system which can do 
                            this work but are costly as well as have difficult for beginner to operate for institutions present in rural areas. 
                            Our project makes a system for solving record keeping problem for cheaper cost as well with an easy menu system.
                            In conclusion this system is able to perform operations such as input, search through multiple data entries, delete
                             existing record and change existing record along with a security of login system.
